[neopixel ambient]
pin: PB6
#   The pin connected to the neopixel. This parameter must be
#   provided.
chain_count: 36
#   The number of Neopixel chips that are "daisy chained" to the
#   provided pin. The default is 1 (which indicates only a single
#   Neopixel is connected to the pin).
color_order: GRB
#   Set the pixel order required by the LED hardware (using a string
#   containing the letters R, G, B, W with W optional). Alternatively,
#   this may be a comma separated list of pixel orders - one for each
#   LED in the chain. The default is GRB.
#   See the "led" section for information on these parameters.
